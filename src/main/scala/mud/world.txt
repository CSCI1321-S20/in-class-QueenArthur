Library
@
You are in a massive library. Shelves of books extend in spirals around you. Looking up, you see three floors looming over you, 
twisting around a massive round window sky window whose edges are just turning pink with the dawn's first light. In the middle 
of the room is a little reading nook. There are stairs leading upwards and a massive wooden door.

Library Second Floor

The second floor of the library is much like the first. There are more shelves and more reading nooks. There is also a balcony 
overlooking the first floor. If you lean out over the railing you can see the labrynthine shelves below and the skylight above.
The stairs to the third floor are corded off with a sign written in a foreign language.
