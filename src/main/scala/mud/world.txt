Library

You are in a massive library. Shelves of books extend in spirals around you. Looking up, you see three floors looming over you, 
twisting around a massive round window sky window whose edges are just turning pink with the dawn's first light. In the middle 
of the room is a little reading nook. There are stairs leading upwards and a massive wooden door.

The second floor of the library is much like the first. There are more shelves and more reading nooks. There is also a balcony 
overlooking the first floor. If you lean out over the railing you can see the labrynthine shelves below and the skylight above.
The stairs to the third floor are corded off with a sign written in a foreign language.

Down the steps of the library a city stretches out before you. Golden spires reach toward the heavens as tree-like buildings weave 
between.  Mesmerizing are the swaying of the branches among their stoic neighbors, a motion intensified by the steady rhythm of the 
sea rising beyond the city, stretching infinitely into the horizon.  Above the city scape, you can just make out the sails of ships, 
caught between the pull of the wind and the play of the waves.  Yet, despite the apparent chaos, people dance effortlessly between 
the differing tempos.  Curriers clamber effortlessly from a swaying rope bridge to the spiraling stair of a golden tower. Children 
leap from solid stairs to swinging ladders, headless of the depths o'er which they climb.
The road that touches the stairs stretches out to the West, South and East.
